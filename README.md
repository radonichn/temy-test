This project was created as a test-task from Temy company

## Way to run 

First you have to go to the /aside/mock-server/ directory and run:

### `npm install`

and then run

### `npm start`

The JSON server has to run on the port 3000, so the link will be http://localhost:3000/

Next, you should run the app. Go to the /src/ directory and run:

### `npm install`

after that, simply type 

### `npm start`

So, now you have run the app ;)
